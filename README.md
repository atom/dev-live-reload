# Dev Live Reload package

This live reloads the Atom `.less` files. You edit styles and they are magically
reflected in any running Atom windows. Magic! :tophat: :sparkles: :rabbit2:

Installed by default on Atom windows running in dev mode. Use `cmd+shift+o` to
open a new dev mode window.

Use `meta-shift-ctrl-r` to reload all core and package stylesheets.

This package is __experimental__, it does not handle the following:

* File additions to a theme. New files will not be watched.
